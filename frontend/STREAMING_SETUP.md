# Streaming Setup Guide

## What's Been Added

Your React frontend now includes a fully functional streaming interface for your LangGraph backend! Here's what's been integrated:

### âœ… New Components Added

1. **`StreamingGraphComponent.tsx`** - Main streaming component using your Shadcn UI design system
2. **Updated `StreamingTutorial.tsx`** - Now uses the new streaming component
3. **Updated navigation** - Streaming tutorial is already linked in your header

### âœ… Features Included

- **Real-time AI thinking display** - Shows internal AI messages temporarily under "Processing..."
- **Progressive updates** - Plan creation, step progress, completion status
- **User approval flow** - Interactive approve/reject/feedback interface
- **Modern UI** - Built with your existing Shadcn UI components and design tokens
- **TypeScript support** - Fully typed for better development experience
- **Error handling** - Graceful error display and recovery

## How to Test

### 1. Start Your Backend

Make sure your backend is running with the new streaming endpoints:

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Start Your Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Streaming Interface

1. **Navigate to Streaming**: Click "Streaming Tutorial" in the header or go to `/streaming`
2. **Enter a Query**: Type a question like:
   - "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
   - "Show me customer analysis for the last quarter"
   - "Create a report on sales trends"

3. **Watch the Magic**: You'll see:
   - Status updates in real-time
   - Temporary "AI is thinking..." messages that auto-hide
   - Plan creation and step progress
   - Approval interface if human feedback is needed
   - Final results with clean presentation

### 4. Test Approval Flow

If your LangGraph is configured to require human approval:

1. Enter a query that triggers approval
2. Review the generated plan
3. Try different actions:
   - **Approve** - Continue execution
   - **Provide Feedback** - Add comments and continue
   - **Reject** - Cancel execution

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used

- `POST http://localhost:8000/graph/start/stream` - Start streaming execution
- `POST http://localhost:8000/graph/resume/stream` - Resume after user feedback

### Event Types Handled

- `status` - Execution status updates
- `ai_thinking` - Internal AI reasoning (temporary display)
- `plan_update` - Execution plan updates
- `step_progress` - Step completion updates
- `waiting_feedback` - User approval required
- `completed` - Execution finished
- `error` - Error occurred

### UI Components Used

- **Shadcn UI Cards** - For content sections
- **Buttons** - With proper variants and states
- **Inputs & Labels** - For query and feedback forms
- **Lucide Icons** - For visual indicators
- **Custom loading states** - With spinners and status indicators

## Customization

The component is fully customizable. You can:

1. **Modify styling** - All using your existing Tailwind classes
2. **Add more event types** - Extend the `handleStreamEvent` function
3. **Custom status indicators** - Update the `StatusIcon` component
4. **Different layouts** - Modify the card structure

## Troubleshooting

### If streaming doesn't work:

1. Check backend logs for the new streaming endpoints
2. Verify CORS settings allow streaming
3. Check browser developer console for errors
4. Ensure backend is running on port 8000

### If styling looks off:

1. Verify all Shadcn UI components are installed
2. Check that Tailwind CSS is properly configured
3. Ensure your design tokens are loaded

## Architecture

```
Frontend Component â†’ Fetch API â†’ Backend SSE Stream â†’ Real-time Updates

StreamingGraphComponent
â”œâ”€â”€ useGraphStream (custom hook)
â”œâ”€â”€ Event handling (SSE parsing)
â”œâ”€â”€ UI state management
â””â”€â”€ Shadcn UI components
```

The implementation uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for optimal performance and reliability, with automatic reconnection and error handling built-in.

Your users can now see exactly what the AI is thinking and doing in real-time! ðŸŽ‰
